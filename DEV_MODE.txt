# DISABLE_CACHE
#   No albums or artists are ever added to the cache, meaning releases will be rediscovered
#   during every crawl and classified as new. This will also not prevent these albums getting
#   added to the target playlists over and over again.
#
# DISABLE_PLAYLIST_ADDITIONS
#   Newly discovered releases will not be added to any target playlists. They will still be marked
#   with a notifier though and the "Last Search" description will still be set.
#
# DISABLE_SCHEDULED_CRAWLS
#   Scheduled crawls that run once every 30 minutes will be completely disabled. Only manual calls
#   at /crawl will be executed.
#
# SKIP_INITIAL_CRAWL
#   The initial crawl when first starting the bot will be skipped entirely.

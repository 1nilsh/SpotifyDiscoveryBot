First setup:
- An extremely light, yet pleasing way to interactively control the basic setup of the bot
- Creating playlists should be done automatically (or can be specified by the user? might be too much work)
- All settings should be toggleable with one of these fancy sliding switches
- It should be possible to change these settings at any time!
- Impl note: Since currently the application only works with one user per instance, an extra instance will need to be provided (gotta see how much performance this kills)
- Settings [brackets denote the default setting]:
	- The four base release types (albums, singles, compilations, appears_ons) [all enabled]
	- Separation (EPs, remixes, live) [none enabled, will request to create new playlists when enabled for the first time]
	- Circular playlist fitting [enabled]
	- Intelligent appears_on search [enabled]
	- Show new notification marker [enabled -- extra options when enabling it become available, symbols get removed from all playlists when disabled]
		- Allow for symbol customization [black/white circles]
		- Toggle between displaying the symbols before or after the playlist name [before]

	
Other ideas:
- Move batch_playlist_addition and cache_followed_artists to config_static (might remove them entirely, you wouldn't ever use them for anything but the current settings)
- [EPIC] Multi-user support for one instance

Improvements:
- Blacklist certain release types for certain artists (for example if you hate appears_on contributions by a certain artist but like their own stuff)
